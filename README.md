# DreamAutomation

This project was done by me and my project partner Nahid Hasan kakon as a undergraduate software development project of courseware.

The name of our project is :  Automation of DREAM(A Voluntary blood Donation society of KUET) . It is desktop based software implemented with JAVA that stores information of members of dream into a database. So basically we used java to store specific information into database, retrieve information of eligible blood donor and moreover update their information. We used MySQL, an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)
