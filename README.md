# DreamAutomation

Dream is a volunteering organization focused on managing blood, based on Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh. I collaborated with Nahid Hasan kakon to build a Java based software a system to efficiently manage all the related user information for this organization. This project was done as part of a course project named "Software Development Project 1".

This desktop based Java software stores information of members of "Dream organization" into a MySQL database. With a charming Graphical User interface  (GUI), the administrator of the program can insert  specific information into the database, perform query to retrieve information of eligible blood donors who has not given blood for last 3 months. Moreover, if any user wants to updaty any Information, he/she can also do that. Basically, CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE (CRUD) all is in here.
